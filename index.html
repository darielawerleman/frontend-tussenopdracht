    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p class="discover">Discover the unlimited possibilities with the Plumbus. The Plumbus is an all-purpose home device</p>
    <p>- the Plumbus can generate and store vast amounts of heat, allowing it to be used for cooking, ironing or just heating the room.</p>
      <p>- the Plumbus can secrete various agents from itself and has adaptive rubbing surfaces, making it useful for cleaning.</p>
       <p>- the Plumbus is able to receive radio waves and convert them to sound, even recording and playing them back, so it can be used as a radio and/or receiver.</p>
      <p>- the Plumbus has limited locomotion and can autonomously move around the house, even climbing ladders, cleaning the floor without the owner's participation.</p>
        <p class="warning"> Contrary to popular belief, plumbus is not used as a personal massager/sensory stimulator, as its manual explicitly says that applying it to sensory organs can cause trauma or death.</p>
